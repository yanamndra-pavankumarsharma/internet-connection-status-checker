# Internet Connection Status Checker

A simple web-based application that checks the internet connection status using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It periodically checks the connectivity and displays the status on the webpage.

## Features

- **Simple UI**: A clean, responsive interface for displaying internet connectivity status.
- **Real-time Status**: Automatically checks internet connection at regular intervals and updates the UI.
- **Pure Frontend**: Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – no backend or server-side code required.

## How It Works

The JavaScript code pings a specific URL (e.g., `https://www.google.com`) at regular intervals to check if there is an active internet connection. If the connection is successful, it displays a "Connected" message; otherwise, it shows "Disconnected."

## Files

- `index.html` – Contains the HTML structure for the page.
- `styles.css` – Stylesheet for the application UI.
- `script.js` – JavaScript code to check internet connectivity and update the UI.
